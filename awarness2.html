      <h3>What does it mean to self-isolate?</h3>
      <p class="low">Self-isolation is an important measure taken by those who have COVID-19 symptoms to avoid infecting others in the community, including family members.</p>
      <p class="low">-  If a person is in self-isolation, it is because he/she is ill but not severely ill (requiring medical attention)<br>

1.have a large, well-ventilated with hand-hygiene and toilet facilities<br>
2.If this is not possible, place beds at least 1 metre apart<br>
3.Keep at least 1 metre from others, even from your family members<br>
4.Monitor your symptoms daily<br>
5.Isolate for 14 days, even if you feel healthy<br>
6.If you develop difficulty breathing, contact your healthcare provider immediately â€“ call them first if possible<br>
7.Stay positive and energized by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising yourself at home.

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>What is the difference between self-isolation, self-quarantine, self-distancing?</h3>
      <p class="low">Quarantine means restricting activities or separating people who are not ill themselves but may have been exposed to COVID-19. The goal is to prevent spread of the disease at the time when people just develop symptoms.
      </p>
      <p class="low">Isolation means separating people who are ill with symptoms of COVID-19 and may be infectious to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>
      <p class="low">Physical distancing means being physically apart. WHO recommends keeping at least 1-metre distance from others. This is a general measure that everyone should take even if they are well with no known exposure to COVID-19. </p>
    </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4" >
      <h3>Can children or adolescents catch COVID-19?</h3>        
      <p class="low">Research indicates that children and adolescents are just as likely to become infected as any other age group and can spread the disease.</p>
      <p class="low">Evidence to date suggests that children and young adults are less likely to get severe disease, but severe cases can still happen in these age groups.</p>
      <p class="low">Children and adults should follow the same guidance on self-quarantine and self-isolation if there is a risk they have been exposed or are showing symptoms. It is particularly important that children avoid contact with older people and others who are at risk of more severe disease.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?</h3>
      <p class="low">While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of mild COVID-19, there are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials of both western and traditional medicines. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19 and will continue to provide updated information as soon research results become available.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Does who recommend wearing medical masks to prevent spread of COVID-19?</h3>        
      <p class="low">Currently, there is not enough evidence for or against the use of masks (medical or other) in healthy individuals in the wider community. However, WHO is actively studying the rapidly evolving science on masks and continuously updates its guidance.<br>Medical masks are recommended primarily in health care settings, but can be considered in other circumstances (see below). Medical masks should be combined with other key infection prevention and control measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet or other animals?</h3>        
      <p class="low">Several dogs and cats (domestic cats and tigers) in contact with infected humans have tested positive for COVID-19. In addition, ferrets appear to be susceptible to the infection. In experimental conditions, both cats and ferrets were able to transmit infection to other animals of the same species. However, there is no evidence that these animals can transmit the disease to humans and spread COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks.</p>
      <p class="low">Minks raised in farms have also been detected with the virus. Most likely, they have been infected by farm workers. In a few instances, the minks that were infected by humans have transmitted the virus to other people. These are the first reported cases of animal-to-human transmission.</p>
